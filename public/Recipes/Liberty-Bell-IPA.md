## Brewer's Notes
This is a classic American IPA, aiming for a bright hop character with citrus and pine notes, supported by a clean malt backbone. Pay close attention to fermentation temperature to ensure a clean yeast profile. Water chemistry is important for IPAs; target a sulfate to chloride ratio of around 2:1 to 3:1 to accentuate hop bitterness and dryness.

**Target Profile:**
* **OG:** 1.065
* **FG:** 1.012
* **ABV:** ~7.0%
* **IBU:** 60-70
* **SRM:** 6-8 (Gold to Light Amber)

## Mashing
* **Strike Water Volume:** Adjust based on your system, aiming for a mash thickness of around 1.3-1.5 qt/lb (2.7-3.1 L/kg).
* **Strike Water Temperature:** Heat strike water to approximately 165-168°F (74-76°C) to achieve a mash temperature of 150-152°F (65-67°C).
* **Mash Schedule:**
    * **Saccharification Rest:** Hold at 150-152°F (65-67°C) for 60 minutes.
* **Mash Out (Optional):** Raise temperature to 168-170°F (75-76°C) for 10 minutes if you perform a mash-out.
* **Sparge:** Sparge with water at 168-170°F (75-76°C) until desired pre-boil volume is collected.

## Boil
* **Boil Duration:** 60 minutes.
* **Hop Additions (60-minute boil):**
    * **60 min:** Bittering hops (e.g., Magnum, Warrior) to achieve target IBUs. (e.g., 1 oz / 28g of 12% AA Magnum)
    * **15 min:** Flavor hops (e.g., Centennial, Simcoe). (e.g., 1 oz / 28g of Centennial)
    * **15 min:** Irish moss or other kettle finings.
* **Note:** Ensure a rolling boil throughout the 60 minutes.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
* **Flameout:** Turn off heat.
* **Cool to Whirlpool Temp:** Allow wort to cool slightly, or actively cool, to around 170-180°F (77-82°C). This helps preserve volatile aroma compounds.
* **Whirlpool Hops:** Add aroma hops (e.g., Citra, Mosaic, Amarillo). (e.g., 2 oz / 56g total, mix of Citra & Mosaic)
* **Whirlpool Duration:** Steep for 20-30 minutes while gently stirring or whirlpooling.

## Cooling
* **Target Temperature:** Rapidly cool the wort to yeast pitching temperature, typically 65-68°F (18-20°C) for American Ale yeast.
* **Method:** Use an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, or plate chiller. Ensure all equipment is sanitized.

## Fermentation
* **Yeast:** Pitch a healthy starter or an appropriate amount of rehydrated dry yeast (e.g., SafAle US-05, Wyeast 1056 American Ale, White Labs WLP001 California Ale Yeast).
* **Oxygenation/Aeration:** Adequately oxygenate or aerate the cooled wort before or during yeast pitching.
* **Primary Fermentation Temperature:** Maintain 65-68°F (18-20°C) for the duration of active fermentation (typically 5-7 days, or until FG is stable).
* **Dry Hopping (Optional but Recommended for IPAs):**
    * **Timing:** Add dry hops 2-3 days before packaging, or when fermentation is near completion (e.g., a few points above terminal gravity).
    * **Hops:** Use aroma-forward varieties. (e.g., 2-3 oz / 56-84g total, mix of Galaxy, Citra, or other favorites)
    * **Duration:** 3-5 days of contact time for dry hops.

## Bottling/Kegging
* **Verify Final Gravity:** Ensure fermentation is complete by taking consistent FG readings over 2-3 days.
* **Transfer:** Carefully transfer the beer off the yeast sediment and dry hops into a bottling bucket or keg. Avoid splashing to minimize oxygen exposure.
* **Priming (Bottling):**
    * If bottling, use priming sugar (e.g., corn sugar/dextrose) to achieve desired carbonation levels (typically 2.2-2.5 volumes of CO2 for American IPAs). Boil priming sugar in a small amount of water, cool, and gently mix into the beer.
* **Carbonation (Kegging):**
    * If kegging, transfer to a sanitized keg and force carbonate to 2.2-2.5 volumes of CO2.
* **Conditioning:** Allow the beer to condition for at least 1-2 weeks (bottled or kegged) for flavors to meld and carbonation to complete. Serve fresh to enjoy the hop character at its peak.
