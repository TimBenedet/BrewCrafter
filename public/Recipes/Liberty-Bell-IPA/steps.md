## Brewer's Notes
This is a classic American IPA recipe, aiming for a good balance of hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma, supported by a clean malt backbone. Water chemistry should be adjusted for a hop-forward beer (e.g., higher sulfate to chloride ratio).

## Mashing
**Target Mash Temp:** 66°C (151°F)
* Mash In: Heat 18L of strike water to about 72°C (162°F). Add crushed grains, stirring well to avoid dough balls. The temperature should settle around 66°C.
* Rest: Hold the mash at 66°C for 60 minutes.
* Mash Out: Raise the mash temperature to 76°C (168°F) and hold for 10 minutes. This stops enzymatic activity and aids in lautering.

## Sparge
* Lauter and sparge with approximately 12-14L of water at 76°C (168°F). Collect around 25L of wort in the kettle.

## Boil
**Total Boil Time:** 60 minutes
* Bring wort to a rolling boil.
* **60 min (Start of boil):** Add 20g Centennial hops.
* **30 min:** Add 25g Simcoe hops.
* **15 min:** Add 1 tsp Irish Moss (or other kettle finings).
* **0 min (Flameout):** Turn off heat.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
* Cool wort to 82°C (180°F).
* Add 30g Citra hops.
* Stir gently to create a whirlpool and let stand for 20 minutes.

## Cooling
* Cool the wort rapidly to 19-20°C (66-68°F). Use an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, or an ice bath.

## Fermentation
**Yeast:** Wyeast 1056 American Ale (or SafAle US-05, or similar clean American ale yeast)
* Prepare yeast starter if using liquid yeast, or rehydrate dry yeast according to manufacturer's instructions.
* Transfer cooled wort to a sanitized fermenter, leaving trub behind.
* Aerate the wort thoroughly (e.g., by shaking the fermenter or using an oxygenation stone).
* Pitch yeast.
* Ferment at 19-20°C (66-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until fermentation activity subsides and gravity is stable for 2-3 consecutive days.
* **Dry Hop (Optional but Recommended):** After primary fermentation is complete (or nearly complete, around day 5-7), add 30g Mosaic hops directly to the fermenter. Let sit for 3-5 days.

## Bottling/Kegging
* Cold crash the beer for 24-48 hours at 0-4°C (32-39°F) if possible, to help clarify.
* **If Bottling:**
    * Sanitize bottles and caps.
    * Prepare a priming sugar solution (e.g., ~100-120g corn sugar for a 20L batch, boiled in a small amount of water).
    * Gently rack beer into a bottling bucket, leaving yeast sediment behind. Mix priming solution evenly.
    * Fill bottles, cap, and let carbonate at room temperature for 2-3 weeks.
* **If Kegging:**
    * Sanitize keg and CO2 lines.
    * Gently transfer beer to the keg.
    * Purge headspace with CO2.
    * Force carbonate to approximately 2.4-2.6 volumes of CO2.
* Condition the beer (bottled or kegged) for at least 1-2 weeks, preferably cold, before serving.
