## Brewer's Detailed Procedure
This American Amber Ale is a balanced, malt-forward beer with a pleasant hop aroma. Easy to brew and even easier to drink.

## Mashing
*   **Grain Preparation:** Mill your grains. Aim for a consistent crush. Darker specialty grains can be milled slightly finer if desired.
*   **Strike Water:** Heat 18 liters (4.75 gal) of brewing water to 72°C (161.6°F).
*   **Mash In:** Combine grains with strike water. Stir well to avoid dough balls. Aim for a mash temperature of 67°C (152.6°F).
*   **Rest:** Maintain mash temperature at 67°C (152.6°F) for 60 minutes.
*   **Mash Out:** After the rest, raise temperature to 76°C (168.8°F) and hold for 10 minutes. This stops enzymatic activity.

## Boil
*   **Lauter & Sparge:** Collect wort by lautering. Sparge with approximately 10-12 liters (2.6-3.2 gal) of water at 76°C (168.8°F), or until pre-boil volume of approx. 23 liters (6.0 gal) is reached.
*   **Boil Duration:** Total boil time is 60 minutes.
*   **60 min (Start of Boil):** Add 30g of Cascade hops for bittering.
*   **15 min (Remaining):** Add 1 tsp of Irish Moss for clarity.
*   **10 min (Remaining):** Add 30g of Amarillo hops for flavor and aroma.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
*   **Flameout:** At the end of the boil, turn off the heat.
*   **Whirlpool:** Stir the wort vigorously to create a whirlpool. Let it settle for 15-20 minutes. This helps collect trub in the center of the kettle.
*   **Optional Hop Stand:** Add 30g of Cascade hops during the whirlpool for extra aroma (not included in IBU calculation).

## Cooling
*   **Cool Wort:** Cool the wort rapidly to fermentation temperature, ideally around 18-20°C (64-68°F) for Safale US-05. Use an immersion chiller or counterflow chiller.

## Fermentation
*   **Transfer & Aerate:** Transfer the cooled wort to a sanitized fermenter, leaving most of the trub behind. Aerate the wort well (e.g., by shaking the fermenter or using an oxygenation stone).
*   **Pitch Yeast:** Pitch one packet of rehydrated Safale US-05 yeast.
*   **Primary Fermentation:** Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until fermentation activity subsides and final gravity is stable.
*   **Optional Dry Hop:** Add 30g of Cascade hops for dry hopping 3-5 days before bottling/kegging.

## Bottling/Kegging
*   **Priming (Bottling):** If bottling, use approximately 4-5g of corn sugar per liter (or a priming sugar calculator) to achieve desired carbonation.
*   **Conditioning:** Allow bottles or kegs to condition for at least 2 weeks at room temperature before chilling and serving.
