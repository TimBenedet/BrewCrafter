This is a classic American Amber Ale. Focus on clean fermentation and good hop aroma. Water profile adjusted for a balanced malt-hop profile.

## Mashing
**Target Mash Temp:** 67°C (152°F)
* Mash In: Heat 15L of strike water to 73°C. Dough in grains. Temperature should stabilize around 67°C.
* Rest: Hold at 67°C for 60 minutes.
* Mash Out: Raise temperature to 76°C (168°F). Hold for 10 minutes.

## Sparge
* Sparge with 12-14L of water at 76°C (168°F) to collect approximately 23L of wort.

## Boil
**Total Boil Time:** 60 minutes
* 60 min: Add 30g Cascade hops.
* 15 min: Add Irish Moss or other kettle finings.
* 10 min: Add 30g Amarillo hops.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
* At flameout, cool wort to 80-85°C (176-185°F).
* Add 30g Cascade hops for a 20-minute whirlpool.

## Cooling
* Cool wort rapidly to 18-20°C (64-68°F) for yeast pitching.

## Fermentation
**Yeast:** Safale US-05 (or similar American Ale yeast)
* Pitch yeast and aerate wort well.
* Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until FG is stable.
* Optional: Dry hop for 3-5 days towards the end of fermentation or after primary.

## Bottling/Kegging
* If bottling, prime with corn sugar to achieve 2.2-2.5 volumes of CO2.
* If kegging, force carbonate to desired level.
* Condition for at least 1-2 weeks before enjoying.
