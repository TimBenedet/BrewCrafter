## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep amber (#D4A000) to evoke the color of beer.
- Background color: Light tan (#F2E6D9), a very low saturation tint of the primary, to suggest paper.
- Accent color: Russet (#80461B), an analogous color for call to actions, darker than the primary for good contrast.
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font for readability.
- Use simple, line-based icons related to brewing for visual cues.
- Maintain a minimalist layout with plenty of white space to focus on content.
- Use subtle animations, such as a smooth transition when displaying recipe details.
